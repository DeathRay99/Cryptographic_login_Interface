# Cryptographic Login Interface

## Implementation
<p>
I have created our own cryptographic algorithm which 
can do both encryption and decryption. I have named it Ascii Cipher, which is based on operations on ascii value of characters.
As for web implementation we have created a single page Sign Up/ Login form.<br>

<li>	During Signup Phase : password entered as plaintext will be encrypted into ciphertext and this text will be stored in the database.</li>
<li> During Login Phase : password entered by the user first will be checked via decrypting the cipher password kept in database. </li>

</p>


## Technology Used
* React Js
* Google Firebase
* Vanilla JavaScript
* Html/ CSS

## Algorithm 
Cipher Technique used is **Ascii Cipher**
